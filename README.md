This capstone project was my first dive into hypothesis testing, so I ask that you forgive the crudeness. I wanted to maintain that sense of "growth" from one project to another by not adding new skills to it. Instead, having it to focus on storytelling and thought process. The image links are broken because I lost them. Lessons learned from being new to portfolio building.

The images were essentally representations of the different eras of baseball. One was black and white, from the 60s, showing the mound height difference. Another was a common representation of Barry Bonds, and how he went from a lanky dude to a behemoth. The remaining photo(s) then focused on the stats era such as measuring launch angle and the highest and lowest batting averages based on that angle of attack.
